We would like to notify you that on 14th of October, 30km south of Dankas, a Search & Rescue Team found Worthington’s delivery group shuttle No.1356777KE crashed. The delivery group's remains and the cargo were recovered from the site. 

The initial investigation suggests the flight stabiliser's malfunction as a possible reason for the shuttle crash. A special commission was assembled at the initiative of the NSola coordinating council. Sabotage is possible.

In relation to Worthington’s delivery group's death and Research Group Chief Creighton’s death preceding it, the rival company attack should be considered highly probable. The hazard level is recommended to be raised up to the 3rd.

Shansky’s delivery group has been placed under your command to replace Worthington’s group. The dossier is attached.

Prompt report of an accident.

On 26th of September, one of the items attempted to escape. During apprehension, an accident occurred. As a result, 12 security bots were put out of service, the technical infrastructure of the facility was damaged and the chief migration engineer was killed. 
Engineering service is suspended. 
Production is expected to be delayed for 2-3 weeks.

Report of an incident on 26th of September

[font "System\\Verdana.ttf", align left, height 18, indent 25]
In the evening of 26th of September the HD512 item, maintained by the private zone, tried to escape from the barracks section. It immobilized the staff at gunpoint, blew up the wall of the sanitary area with the help of an I.E.D. and broke into technical tunnels where it faced security bots. 

The high power switchboard No.124 was damaged in the crossfire and it led to its detonation and a partial collapse of the structure.


The result is:

[indent 0, left 50]
1. Equipment in 3 rooms of the engineering section was damaged.

2. 12 security bots were put out of service.

3. Technical tunnels No.17 and No.42 were blocked.

4. Infrastructure is damaged.

5. Chief Migration Engineer Wolf was in the south corridor at the moment of the collapse and was killed under the rubble. In place of the deceased engineer Wolf, his trainee engineer Skinner was appointed.


[indent 25, left 0]
The circumstances of the escape are under investigation by detective Jensen now.

Overall damage is being estimated.

As the equipment and infrastructure were damaged, production delays up to 7 days are possible.

Report of the anchor accident aftermath

[font "System\\Verdana.ttf", height 18, align left, indent 25]
The sequence of the events:

[left 50, indent 0]
18:35 Shift on duty detected a detonation at the anchor cooling system.

18:40 Peak output power jumped to 5000 MG with a feedback of 4.5. Adding stabilizers to the active zone reduces the feedback to 3.2, but the peak output never drops under 5000 MG. 

18:42 Technical service staff were raised by alarm by the Shift Supervisor's decision.

18:44 Central core stabilization system failure and a subsequent entropic flash of 18GHn were detected.

18:53 Technical service managed to shut down the central core with a reverse current. 

18:55 Emergency power supply was activated.

[left 0, indent 25]
As at 20:30

[left 50, indent 0]
1. After examining the main systems of the central and auxiliary cores, it was an concluded that the cause of the detonation was an explosive device placed under coolant lines.

2. Central core is critical. Stabilization system is malfunctioning. Cooling system is significantly damaged, coolant leak is observed.

3. Anchor restart using the auxiliary core is impossible owing to the stability system's extensive damage. Core membrane melting, entropic cascade and a secondary flash of 50 GHn are highly possible.

4. Entropy level is critical, doesn’t go lower than 5200 Hnph. The staff are showing signs of the 2nd and 3rd stages of entromutation. Immediate evac required. Alert systems activated.

Brief report of HD512 diagnostic research results

[font "System\\Verdana.ttf", height 18, align left, indent 25]
In the course of the initial diagnostic research carried out at the stage of the item training, diagnostic engineer Strauss discovered a secondary cognitive loop, controlling the mimic. He had failed to neutralize that loop by conventional means so the item was decommissioned and transferred to the private zone. 

After the accident and subsequent Strauss’s arrest as an accomplice, at my initiative engineer Popper undertook a restudy.

The results of the initial research were confirmed. The item indeed has a cognitive loop, however its influence has recently spread. It’s impossible to determine if it happened as a result of Strauss’s actions, or natural causes.

Strauss’s initial assumption about potentially existing similar loops among the transported items makes sense. Further research of the item using our equipment isn’t possible.

Detailed report is attached.

Investigation report

[font "System\\Verdana.ttf", height 18, align left, indent 25]
During the investigation it was found that it is Dr. Dorian who was responsible for the theft of medical supplies from storage.

In the course of the attempted arrest, Dorian threw medical liquid in officer Dent’s face and, having obtained his sidearm, opened fire. 

Trying to escape, Dorian locked himself in a utility room of the medical sector. The decision to breach the wall through the medical locker room was made to neutralize him. But Dorian had been dead by the moment of break-in.

Having been affected by medication and stress, he wasn’t able to control his acts and tried to escape through the vent by blocking the fan with a crowbar. He didn't manage to block it in an appropriate way and as a result suffered fatal injuries.

Explanatory memorandum

[font "System\\Verdana.ttf", height 18, align left, indent 25]
During my last shift engineer Strauss’s colleagues visited him to solve some work issues. 

In the course of the visit there was a struggle during which the accused was inflicted injuries incompatible with life. He passed away before the arrival of the emergency.

I consider myself innocent, as in a condition of a high hazard level I couldn’t keep an eye on the cell, so I completely trusted the staff.

Medical report based on engineer Strauss’s psychiatric examination

[font "System\\Verdana.ttf", height 18, align left, indent 25]
Engineer Strauss was sent for a psychiatric examination because of numerous complaints, such as:

[left 50, indent 0]
1. Nervousness and persistent conflicts with his colleagues.
2. Violation of the private zone rules (personally trimmed a botty).
3. Fight with security officer Veinheid.
4. Falling productivity.

[left 0, indent 25]
Diagnostic measures taken:

[left 50, indent 0]
1. Examination of engineer Strauss’s file and interviewing colleagues.
2. Personal interview with engineer Strauss in a calm atmosphere.
3. Tetcher’s multifactorial questioning.

[left 0, indent 25]
The research findings:

The patient demonstrates the features of the 2nd stage of entropic refraction (entromutation). Obviously his dominating fixation is the HD512 item, which was confirmed by the patient himself during the interviews. For some reason Strauss distinguishes this item as unique, having its own will and place in the world. Multiple visits exclusively to the given item in the private zone support the former assumption.

Apparently, the fixation arose due to the patient's inability to “fix” the item defects during the diagnostic research. Other needs are clearly regressing.

Recommendations:

It is highly recommended to suspend engineer Strauss from duty due to the high risk of injury to himself and others, and immediately refer him for treatment. His continued presence at the facility is fraught with the inevitable move into the 3rd stage of entromutation.

Report of Straus’s interrogation in relation to the accident on September 23rd

[font "System\\Verdana.ttf", height 18, align left, indent 25]
On September 23rd, engineer Strauss came to the private zone where he had a conflict with security officer Veinheid. During the interrogation engineer Strauss stated that Veinheid took his botty so they got in a fight. He considers Veinheid responsible for the situation. 

Taking into account the fact that engineer Strauss was involved in such an incident for the first time and Engineering Chief P.Richard’s recommendation, it was decided to let him off with a warning.

Report of Engineer Strauss’s interrogation about the accident on 26th of September

[font "System\\Verdana.ttf", height 18, align left, indent 25]
On 9th of October, engineer Strauss was called to testify in relation to the HD512 item escape attempt. At that moment he wasn’t considered as an accomplice and was invited for clarifying the training details of the item. However during the interrogation engineer Strauss was nervous and when pressured he confessed that it was he who organized the escape attempt.

Particularly he took the following actions:

[left 50, indent 0]
1. When visiting the private zone he sneaked the equipment to calibrate the item. 

2. He obtained and gave it the weapon (the gun) with which it neutralized the staff at the barracks.

3. He personally gave it the I.E.D with which it destroyed the wall of the barracks sanitary area. 

4. He plotted the escape through technical tunnels and instructed the item on that plan.

[left 0, indent 25]
The further actions were carried out by the item on its own.

Engineer Strauss doesn’t regret his actions.

As a result of the interrogation it was decided to isolate engineer Strauss in preventive custody for his case further transferring to higher authorities.

K.Popper is appointed an acting Diagnostic Engineer instead of Strauss.

Report of an HD512 item diagnostic research

[font "System\\Verdana.ttf", height 18, align left, indent 25]
HD512 was received from Mulder a week ago. The problem is the mimic resonance absence in spite of a high score according to Martin-Tsunayoshi. The injection and motorics rates are normal, but still she demonstrates a pokerface (in layman’s terms). They don’t understand what's going on, but I’ll explain: they make too much fuss about such a basic test as Martin-Tsunayoshi’s one. They don’t use other tests, as they’re likely not taught to. Meanwhile she has no more than 7 according to Deckard.

Her facial expressions are obviously controlled by a cognitive loop separated from the main cluster. We need a creative solution, as it’s impossible to reach this loop using conventional means. Unfortunately, by the moment it hasn’t been found. 

Though Mulder should’ve known that Martin-Tsunayoshi’s test doesn’t indicate such loops, the number of items like that shipped by his buttheads is still uncertain as well as cognitive clusters they’re able to control. And it makes the problem even worse. So I request that you give me more time for work, as this problem may have long-term consequences for the entire line-up.

Regarding your medical report of engineer Strauss’s obsessive thoughts about one of the items I have to respond the following:

We don’t have any employees of the cerebral diagnostic competency equal to Strauss at the moment. He is irreplaceable.

Solve the problem with medication.

In the morning when turning on duty, I found some evidence of vandalism in the injection section. Particularly, the HD535 item exposed to desecration was found at engineer Lorentz’s workplace.

5 probes of different diameter were removed from the item’s genitalia. The further exploitation is impossible due to the damage suffered. I request to take sanctions against engineer Lorentz and recover the cost of damage from him.

Complaint

[font "System\\Verdana.ttf", height 18, align left, indent 25]
To take out any objects imaginable out of the gallery mannequins, clean them and reset -  that’s what I do at the beginning of every shift. For the past month I’ve collected two buckets of stationery, a set of bottles, about a dozen engineering probes, a collection of beer cans and a full toolbox. I didn’t join up to do such work. Make the administrative stuff put an end to this nonsense or give me a raise. Until then, consider me resigned.

P.S. If someone on the stuff wants to get back anything listed above they’re free to buy it out.

Recently there have been increasing incidents of B-234 substance leak. This substance is of high danger for the staff.

In case of leak detection the neutralizing agent (fluracynthreol) is to be injected to the air filtration system. Emergency filtration is activated automatically.

Contact the laboratory to restock the fluracyntreol.

I heard a rumor that some people on duty don’t like that folks from all over the facility visit the gym, passing their checkpoint.

I’ve got a great idea to move the gym to the residential area.

So you stop complaining, or cross someone else’s checkpoints.

Kane, situation update.

Comms array was damaged by the explosion. Two operbots locked themselves in the arsenal, still no luck to flush them out. One operbot was seen at the engineering. Surveillance is limited, as half of the cameras are not responding. The facility is in panic.

Casualties: control room staff, 4 people on duty, a few engineers. Two dozens wounded.

The whereabouts of the delivery group Commander are yet unknown.
